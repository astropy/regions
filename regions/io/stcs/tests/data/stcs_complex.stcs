# STC-S test file with complex regions and coordinate systems
#
# Some examples inspired by the CDS STC-S Rust implementation:
# https://github.com/cds-astro/cds-stc-rust/
#
# Additional examples created based on the IVOA STC-S standard to test
# various coordinate systems (ICRS, GALACTIC, FK5) and reference positions
# (TOPOCENTER, BARYCENTER, GEOCENTER).

# Example demonstrating TOPOCENTER reference position
Circle ICRS TOPOCENTER 147.6 69.9 0.4

# Position example (spatial coordinates only, temporal coordinates excluded)
Position ICRS BARYCENTER 147.3 69.3

# Examples with various coordinate systems and reference positions
Circle ICRS GEOCENTER 179.0 -11.5 0.5
Ellipse GALACTIC BARYCENTER 90.0 45.0 2.0 1.0 60.0
Box FK5 TOPOCENTER 30.0 60.0 0.5 0.3 15.0
