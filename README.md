About
-----

This is an experimental package defining an API for representing regions
(both on the sky and in pixel coordinates). Initial discussion related to
this happened as part of the
[Python in Astronomy](python-in-astronomy.github.io) workshop, and the
current API is the result of discussions between Tom Robitaille and Perry
Greenfield. If you are interested in contributing, please contact either of
us!

* [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org) 1.0 or later
* [spherical_geometry](https://github.com/spacetelescope/sphere)
