  the outer width/height could be smaller than the inner width/height.
  [#425]

- Fixed an issue converting elliptical and rectangular annulus regions
  between pixel and sky regions. [#425]

  [#444]

API Changes
-----------

- Removed the following deprecated I/O classes and functions:
  ``crtf_objects_to_string``, ``ds9_objects_to_string``,
  ``fits_region_object_to_table``, ``read_crtf``, ``read_ds9``,
  ``read_fits``, ``read_fits_region``, ``write_crtf``, ``write_ds9``,
  ``write_fits``, ``write_fits_region`` ``CRTFParser``, ``DS9Parser``,
  ``FITSRegionParser``, ``ShapeList``, and ``Shape``. The ``Regions``
  and ``Region`` objects now support this functionality via a unified
  I/O interface. [#386]

- Removed the deprecated ``BoundingBox`` ``slices`` attribute. [#386]

- The default matplotlib keywords that are used when plotting now depend
  on the value of ``self.visual['default_style']``. This keyword is
  currently set (to a value of 'ds9') only when reading DS9 region
  files. If set to 'ds9', DS9 plotting defaults are used. If not set or
  set to 'mpl' or None, then the matplotlib defaults will be used, with
  the exception that fill is turned off for Patch and Line2D artists.

- Renamed the ``BoundingBox`` class to ``RegionBoundingBox``. The old
  name is deprecated. [#427]

- A ``ValueError`` is raised if the radius, width, or height region
  parameters are not strictly positive (> 0). [#430]

- Added a ``precision`` keyword to the DS9 serializer and writer to
  specify the number of decimal places in output numbers. [#436]

- The ``errors`` keyword was removed from the DS9 parser and reader and
  the ``coordsys``, ``radunit``, and ``fmt`` keywords were removed from
  the DS9 serializer and writer.  The new ``precision`` keyword can be
  used when serializing and writing DS9 regions. [#436]

- The ``PixelRegion.plot()`` method now returns a
  ``matplotlib.artist.Artist`` object, which can be used in plot legends.
  [#441]

- FITS region files are now always parsed and serialized as
  ``PixelRegion`` objects. They can be converted to ``SkyRegion``
  objects using a WCS object. [#444]


0.5 (2021-07-20)
================

General
-------

- The infrastructure of the package has been updated in line with the
  APE 17 guidelines. The main changes are that the ``python setup.py
  test`` and ``python setup.py build_docs`` commands will no longer
  work. The easiest way to replicate these commands is to install the
  tox (https://tox.readthedocs.io) package and run ``tox -e test`` and
  ``tox -e build_docs``. It is also possible to run pytest and sphinx
  directly. Other significant changes include switching to setuptools_scm
  to manage the version number, and adding a ``pyproject.toml`` to opt in
  to isolated builds as described in PEP 517/518. [#315]

- Bump the minimum required version of Astropy to 3.2.

New Features
------------

- Added a ``as_mpl_selector`` method to the rectangular and ellipse
  pixel-based regions. This method returns an interactive Matplotlib
  selector widget. [#317]

- Added a ``get_overlap_slices`` method to ``BoundingBox``. [#348]

- Added a ``center`` attribute to ``BoundingBox``. [#348]

- Added ``get_overlap_slices`` method to ``RegionMask``. [#350]

- Added ``get_values`` method to ``RegionMask``. [#351, #353]

- Added a ``Regions`` class with a unified I/O interface for reading,
  writing, parsing, and serializing regions. [#378]

- Added ``serialize`` and ``write`` methods to all ``Region``
  subclasses. [#378]

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed an issue where ``RegionMask.multiply`` ``fill_value`` was not
  applied to pixels outside of the mask, but within the region bounding
  box. [#346]

- Fixed an issue where ``RegionMask.cutout`` would raise an error if
  ``fill_value`` was non-finite and the input array was integer type.
  [#346]

- A ``ValueError`` is now raised when calling ``BoundingBox.slices``
  when ``ixmin`` or ``iymin`` is negative. [#347]

- Fixed an issue in the DS9 parser where uppercase coordinate frames
  would fail. [#237]

- Fixed an issue where the CRTF file parser would fail if the CRTF
  version number was included on the first line. [#240]

- Fixed an issue where the CRTF file parser would fail if there was a
  space after the region name. [#271]

- Fixed an issue where the CRTF file parser was too restrictive about
  requiring the last and first polynomial coordinates to be the same.
  [#359, #362]

- Fixed a bug where an ``EllipsePixelRegion`` with zero height and/or
  width would raise a ``ValueError`` when creating a ``RegionMask``.
  [#363]

- Fixed parsing CRTF regions files that do not have a comma after the
  region. [#364]

- Fixed parsing CRTF regions files that contain a ``symthick`` value.
  [#365]

- Fixed an issue where ``PointPixelRegion`` objects would not plot.
  [#366]

- Fixed an issue where DS9 annulus regions with more than one annulus
  would not be parsed correctly. Such regions are skipped for now. [#371]

- Fixed an issue where ``Angle`` values for ``SkyRegion`` shape
  parameters could be incorrectly serialized. [#380]

- Fixed an issue where a semicolon in the DS9 text field would raise an
  error. [#381,#383]

- Fixed an issue where DS9 regions without metadata would not be parsed
  correctly. [#382]

- Fixed an issue parsing spaces in DS9 region metadata. [#384]

API Changes
-----------

- Deprecated the ``BoundingBox`` ``slices`` attribute. [#348]

- The ``RegionMeta`` and ``RegionVisual`` classes have been moved to the
  ``regions.core.metadata`` module. [#371]

- Deprecated the ``read_fits_region`` and ``write_fits_region``
  functions. Instead, use the ``read_fits`` and ``write_fits``
  functions. Note that the ``write_fits`` function is called as
  ``write_fits(regions, filename)`` for consistency with the other
  functions that write files. [#376]

- The following helper functions were removed from the public API:
  ``to_shape_list``, ``to_crtf_meta``, ``to_ds9_meta``,
  ``CRTFRegionParser``, ``DS9RegionParser``, ``CoordinateParser``,
  and ``FITSRegionRowParser``. [#375]

- Deprecated the following I/O classes and functions:
  ``crtf_objects_to_string``, ``ds9_objects_to_string``,
  ``fits_region_object_to_table``, ``read_crtf``, ``read_ds9``,
  ``read_fits``, ``write_crtf``, ``write_ds9``, ``write_fits``,
  ``CRTFParser``, ``DS9Parser``, ``FITSRegionParser``, ``ShapeList``,
  and ``Shape``. The ``Regions`` and ``Region`` objects now support this
  functionality via a unified I/O interface. [#378]

- Existing ``ds9`` and ``crtf`` region files will not be overwritten
  by default with the ``write`` functions. Set ``overwrite=True`` to
  overwrite existing files. [#378]

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed a corner-case issue where ``RegionMask.multiply()`` would not set
  non-finite data values outside of the mask but within the bounding box
  to zero. [#278]
- Fix 'text' renamed to 'label' [#234]

Other
-----

- Remove astropy-healpix dependency [#258]
- Use standalone six to avoid deprecation warnings [#235]

  ``DS9`` by default. [#194]

- Now, ``to_mask`` in ``regions.CompoundPixelRegion`` handles negative
  bounding box. [#195]

- Added ``regions.RectangleAnnulusPixelRegion``,
