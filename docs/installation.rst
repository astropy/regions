Installation
************

The regions package requires the following packages:

* Python 2.7 or 3.4 and above
* `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ 1.9 or later
* `Astropy <http://www.astropy.org>`__ 1.2 or later

In addition, the following packages are needed for optional functionality:

* `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`__ 1.5 or later

Stable version
==============

Installing the latest stable version is possible either using pip or conda.

Using pip
---------

To install regions with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_
from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regions>`_, run::

    pip install regions --no-deps

.. note::

    The ``--no-deps`` flag is optional, but highly recommended if you already
    have Numpy installed, since otherwise pip will sometimes try to "help" you
    by upgrading your Numpy installation, which may not always be desired.

Using conda
-----------

To install regions with `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_
from the `astropy channel on anaconda.org <https://anaconda.org/astropy/regions>`__
simply run::

    conda install -c astropy regions
