Reporting Issues and Contributing
=================================

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you have found a bug in Regions please report it by
creating a new issue on the `Regions GitHub issue tracker
<https://github.com/astropy/regions/issues>`_. That requires creating a
`free Github account <https://github.com/>`_ if you do not have one.

Please include an example that demonstrates the issue that will allow
the developers to reproduce and fix the problem. You may also be asked
to provide information about your operating system and a full Python
stack trace. The developers will walk you through obtaining a stack
trace if it is necessary.


Contributing
------------

Like the `Astropy`_ project, Regions is made both by and for its users.
We accept contributions at all levels, spanning the gamut from fixing a
typo in the documentation to developing a major new feature. We welcome
contributors who will abide by the `Python Software Foundation Code of
Conduct <https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/>`_.

Regions follows the same workflow and coding guidelines as `Astropy`_.
The following pages will help you get started with contributing fixes,
code, or documentation (no git or GitHub experience necessary):

* `How to make a code contribution <https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/workflow/development_workflow.html>`_

* `Coding Guidelines <https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/codeguide.html>`_

* `Developer Documentation <https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/#developer-documentation>`_


Getting Help
------------

Besides GitHub, you can `get help`_ from the community in a number of
ways. There is also a slack channel for Regions hosted under the main
Astropy slack.
